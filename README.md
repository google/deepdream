# deepdream

This repository contains IPython Notebook with sample code, complementing 
Google Research [blog post](http://googleresearch.blogspot.ch/2015/06/inceptionism-going-deeper-into-neural.html) about Neural Network art.
See [original gallery](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipPX0SCl7OzWilt9LnuQliattX4OUCj_8EP65_cTVnBmS1jnYgsGQAieQUc1VQWdgQ?key=aVBxWjhwSzg2RjJWLWRuVFBBZEN1d205bUdEMnhB) for more examples.

You can view "dream.ipynb" directly on github, or clone the repository, 
install dependencies listed in the notebook and play with code locally.

It'll be interesting to see what imagery people are able to generate using the described technique. If you post images to Google+, Facebook, or Twitter, be sure to tag them with [#deepdream](https://twitter.com/hashtag/deepdream) so other researchers can check them out too.
